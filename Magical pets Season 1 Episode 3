One day, they were playing at a park and Ekam found a turtle trapped in a box
so she quickly rescued it and brought it home, cleaned it, and named it Pegasus strangely 
she felt a deep connection with it so. After a few days, they both got a dream but a different
one. Ekyom got a dream with a dog and Ekam got it with a turtle named pegasus
Finally, Ekam remembered everything about fairyland, her pet, etc.But poor
Ekyom still doesn't know anything
